# AIML-Stage-2
AI/ML Engineer- Stage 2 Final by SLIIT
Thrilled to have successfully completed the AI/ML Engineer – Stage 2 course! This program strengthened my understanding of supervised machine learning algorithms like Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Naive Bayes, and SVM, along with hands-on Python applications.

• Supervised learning techniques (Linear & Non-linear Regression)

• Logistic Regression for classification problems

• Decision Trees & Random Forest models

• Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machines (SVM)

• Predictive modeling and scenario-based ML problem solving
